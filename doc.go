// Package ohauth allows the creation of OAuth 2.0 providers.
//
// The package defines several interfaces that must be implemented and used to
// configure a Provider. The provider can then be incorporated into a web
// service that provides OAuth 2.0 authorisation functionality.
//
// As a starting point, it is best to look at the Provider documentation and
// proceeding from there to discover the rest of this library.
